# Abstract

Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) represent a promising frontier in machine learning, yet their practical scalability is fundamentally obstructed by the barren plateau problem, wherein gradients vanish exponentially as circuit depth and qubit count increase, rendering gradient-based training effectively infeasible for large-scale systems. This project aims to design, implement, and evaluate an Adaptive Quantum Neural Network (A-QNN) that overcomes this critical limitation through a principled combination of adaptive circuit construction and analytic parameter estimation. Rather than optimizing a fixed-structure ansatz via gradient descent, the proposed methodology grows the quantum circuit incrementally, evaluating candidate gates from a structured pool and retaining only those that maximally reduce the classification cost function. Optimal rotation parameters for each gate are derived analytically from the sinusoidal Fourier structure of quantum expectation values, requiring as few as three measurements per parameter update and entirely eliminating dependence on gradient computation. The system was implemented in Python using PennyLane and evaluated against a fixed-ansatz QNN trained with the COBYLA optimizer on the MNIST 0-vs-1 binary classification task encoded into 10-qubit, 10-feature PCA-reduced representations using 1,000 training and 1,000 test samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the A-QNN achieved 92.9% test accuracy and an AUC-ROC of 0.9984 using a compact circuit of only 14 gates and 14 parameters, outperforming the fixed-ansatz COBYLA method by 48.1 percentage points, which itself failed to learn meaningfully at 44.8% accuracy on the same task. The A-QNN also attained 96.0% training accuracy with a circuit depth of 14 compared to the fixed ansatz depth of 38 and 60 parameters, confirming that adaptive construction yields significantly shallower, more expressive circuits. These findings establish that analytic adaptive training is a viable, hardware-efficient, and highly competitive strategy for practical quantum machine learning.
